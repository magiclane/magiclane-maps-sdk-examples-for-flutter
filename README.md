This repository holds a series of example projects using the **Magic Lane - Maps SDK for Flutter**. More information about the API can be found on the [Documentation](https://developer.magiclane.com/documentation) page.

This set of individual, use-case based projects is designed to be cloned by developers for their own use.

* [Hello Map](hello_map) - Display a map.
* [Calculate Route](calculate_route) - Calculate & display route.
* [Center Coordinates](center_coordinates) - Show how to center the map on coordinates.
* [Follow Position](follow_position) - Show how to set live datasource & `startFollowingPosition`.
* [Map Perspective](map_perspective) - Show how to change map perspective, tilt angle.
* [Multimap View](multiview_map) - Show how to create multiple views.
* [Simulate Route](simulate_route) - Calculate & display route. Simulate route.
* [Navigate Route](navigate_route) - Calculate & display route. Navigate route.
* [Save Favorites](save_favorites) - Show to save landmarks to your favorites list, as well as remove them from favorites list.
* [Text Search](text_search) - Text search. Shows search results and the distance towards them. Highlights the selected result on the map.

**Note:** As the very first step, we highly recommend that you get a token from [Magic Lane Portal](https://developer.magiclane.com/api). If no token is set, you can still test your apps, but a watermark will be displayed, and all the online services including mapping, searching, routing, etc. will slow down after a few minutes.
