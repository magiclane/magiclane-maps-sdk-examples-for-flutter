## Running individual examples

Individual samples can be run on an iOS or Android simulator or device.

Check the `README.md` inside each examples folder for instructions.

## Configuring API Keys

An API Key is required to unlock the full functionality of these example applications. Follow our [guide](https://developer.magiclane.com/docs/guides/get-started) to generate your API Key.

If no API Key is set, you can still test your apps, but a watermark will be displayed, and all the online services including mapping, searching, routing, etc. will slow down after a few minutes.

You can either add your API Key directly in the `main.dart` file or use an environment JSON file with the `--dart-define-from-file` option when running the app.

To use a JSON file, create a file with the following structure:
```json
{
    "GEM_TOKEN": "your_api_key_here"
}
```

Then run any example with:

```bash
flutter run --dart-define-from-file=path/to/json/file.json
```

**Important:** When adding the token directly to `main.dart`, update the `projectApiToken` constant. Always keep your API token secure and never commit it to version control.
