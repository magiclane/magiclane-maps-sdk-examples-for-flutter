**Note:** As the very first step, we highly recommend that you get a token from [Magic Lane Portal](https://developer.magiclane.com/api). If no token is set, you can still test your apps, but a watermark will be displayed, and all the online services including mapping, searching, routing, etc. will slow down after a few minutes.
